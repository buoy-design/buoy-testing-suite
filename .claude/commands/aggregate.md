# Aggregate Statistics Command

Generate and display aggregate statistics from all test results.

## Workflow

1. Run: `./dist/cli.js aggregate`
2. Read: `results/aggregate.md`
3. Summarize key findings:
   - Total repos tested
   - Average components/tokens found
   - Common patterns detected
   - Scanner coverage gaps
